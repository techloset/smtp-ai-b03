# 06 – Strings

This folder focuses on **text data** in Python, which is stored in objects called strings.

## Key ideas

- **Creating strings**  
  Use single or double quotes: `'hello'` or `"hello"`.

- **Indexing and slicing**  
  Access characters with indexes (`name[0]`) and parts of strings with slices (`name[1:4]`).

- **String methods**  
  Useful built-ins like `lower()`, `upper()`, `strip()`, `replace()`, `split()`, `join()`.

- **String formatting**  
  Combine variables and text using **f-strings**: `f\"Hello {name}\"`.

- **Immutability**  
  Strings cannot be changed in place; operations create new strings.

## Why this matters

Almost all programs work with text: user input, file content, messages, and more. Mastering strings makes it easier to build real-world applications.

## Practice exercises

1. **Name formatting**  
   Ask the user for their name and print it in all uppercase, all lowercase, and title case.

2. **Password checker**  
   Ask for a password and check: it must be at least 8 characters and contain the character `"@"`. Print a suitable message.

3. **Word count**  
   Ask the user to enter a sentence, split it into words, and print how many words there are.
