# 03 – Loops (for / while)

This folder covers **repeating actions** with loops.

## Topics in this folder

- **for loops**  
  Repeat a block of code for each item in a sequence (like a list or string) or for a range of numbers.

- **while loops**  
  Repeat a block of code **while** a condition is `True`.

- **break and continue**  
  - `break` stops the loop early.  
  - `continue` skips to the next loop iteration.

- **range() function**  
  Generate a sequence of numbers, often used with `for` loops.

## Recommended file order (roadmap)

Work through these files in this order:

1. `01_for_basic.py` – basic `for` loops that count numbers and loop over a list of names.  
2. `02_for_range_examples.py` – using `range()` for even numbers and a simple countdown.  
3. `03_while_basic.py` – `while` loops that count up and a simple password check that repeats until correct.  
4. `04_break_continue.py` – using `break` to stop a loop early and `continue` to skip some values (e.g. only odd numbers).  
5. `05_nested_loops.py` – loops inside loops to build a small multiplication table and assign students to courses.  
6. `06_combined_loops_example.py` – a realistic shopping-cart style example mixing `for`, `while`, `range`, `break`, and `continue`.

## Why this matters

Loops let your program do **repetitive tasks automatically**, such as processing many items or asking repeatedly until valid input is given.

## Practice exercises

1. **Counting**  
   Use a `for` loop to print the numbers from 1 to 20 on separate lines.

2. **Sum of numbers**  
   Ask the user for a number `n` and use a loop to calculate the sum from 1 to `n`.

3. **Guessing game (while loop)**  
   Pick a secret number in your code and ask the user to guess it. Keep asking until they guess correctly.
