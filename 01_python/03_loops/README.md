# 03 – Loops (for / while)

This folder covers **repeating actions** with loops.

## Key ideas

- **for loops**  
  Repeat a block of code for each item in a sequence (like a list or string) or for a range of numbers.

- **while loops**  
  Repeat a block of code **while** a condition is `True`.

- **break and continue**  
  - `break` stops the loop early.  
  - `continue` skips to the next loop iteration.

- **range() function**  
  Generate a sequence of numbers, often used with `for` loops.

## Why this matters

Loops let your program do **repetitive tasks automatically**, such as processing many items or asking repeatedly until valid input is given.

## Practice exercises

1. **Counting**  
   Use a `for` loop to print the numbers from 1 to 20 on separate lines.

2. **Sum of numbers**  
   Ask the user for a number `n` and use a loop to calculate the sum from 1 to `n`.

3. **Guessing game (while loop)**  
   Pick a secret number in your code and ask the user to guess it. Keep asking until they guess correctly.
