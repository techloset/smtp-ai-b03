"""Basic for loop

We use for loops to repeat an action a fixed number of times or
for each item in a collection.

Examples:
- Send a notification to each user
- Print numbers from 1 to 10
"""

# print("Counting from 1 to 5:")

# for number in range(50, 100 + 1):
#     print("numbers from 50 100", number)

# print("--------------------------------")

# names = ["Ali", "Sara", "Danish"]

# print("Greeting each name in a list:")


# # Practice Examples (add your solutions below):
# # 1. Print all even numbers from 1 to 20
# 0, 1, 2, 3, 4
# for _ in range(5):
#     print("______________________________")
#     print("______________________________")
#     print("______________________________")
#     print("______________________________")
#     print("______________________________")




# # 2number. Calcu_late sum of all numbers from 1 to 50
# curSum = 0
# for number in range(51):
#     curSum = curSum + number
#     print("current sume is ", curSum)


# for _ in range(10):
#     print("Danish")



# # 3. Print each character of your name (use a counter)
var = input("Enter your name: ")

# # 4. Ask user for a number and print its multiplication table (1 to 10)
# # 5. Count how many vowels are in the word "programming"


# # for i in range(0, 20, 5):
# #     print(i)
