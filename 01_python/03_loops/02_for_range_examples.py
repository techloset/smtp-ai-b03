"""for loop with range() - Comprehensive Examples

range() is used to generate a sequence of numbers.
We often use it when we know how many times we want to repeat something.

    range(stop)           -> generates numbers from 0 to stop-1
    range(start, stop)    -> generates numbers from start to stop-1
    range(start, stop, step) -> generates numbers from start to stop-1, incrementing by step


"""
for variable in range(20 , 50, 5):

    print("variable from", variable)

 
# Basic range() usage
# print numbers from 2 to 6
# print even numbers from 0 to 8
# Even numbers from 0 to 10
# Reverse iteration
# sum of numbers from 1 to 10
# Multiplication table for 7
# Factorial calculation
# Print squares and cubes
# Print every 3rd number from 0-20
# sum of even and odd numbers from 1 to 20
