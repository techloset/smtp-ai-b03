# 09 – Modules and Libraries

This folder shows you how to **organize code into modules** and use **Python libraries**.

## Key ideas

- **What is a module?**  
  Any `.py` file can be a module that you can import into another file.

- **Importing modules**  
  Use `import module_name` or `from module_name import function_name`.

- **Standard library**  
  Explore built-in modules like `math`, `random`, `datetime`, and `os`.

- **Third‑party libraries**  
  Learn the idea of installing extra packages (e.g. with `pip`) and importing them.

- **Creating your own modules**  
  Put related functions in one file and reuse them in other programs.

## Why this matters

Modules and libraries let you **reuse code**, keep projects organized, and take advantage of powerful tools written by other developers.

## Practice exercises

1. **Your own module**  
   Create a file `my_math.py` with functions like `square(n)` and `cube(n)`. Import it in another file and use those functions.

2. **Using the math module**  
   Write a program that asks for a number and prints its square root and sine using the `math` library.

3. **Random password**  
   Use the `random` module to generate a simple random password made of letters and digits.
