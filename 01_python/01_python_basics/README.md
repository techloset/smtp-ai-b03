# 01 – Python Basics

This folder introduces the **core building blocks** of Python that you will use everywhere.

## Topics in this folder

- **Printing output**  
  Use `print()` to display messages and values on the screen.

- **Variables**  
  Store information in names (identifiers) so you can reuse values later.

- **Comments**  
  Use `#` to write notes for humans; Python ignores them when running the code.

- **Data types**  
  Numbers (`int`, `float`), text (`str`), Booleans (`True` / `False`), and more.

- **Arithmetic operators**  
  `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `//`, `%`, `**` for basic math and calculations.

- **String concatenation and type conversion**  
  Combine strings with `+` and convert between types using functions like `int()`, `float()`, `str()`.

- **User input**  
  Use `input()` to get information from the user.

- **Basic errors**  
  Learn to read error messages so you can fix problems in your code.

Focus on understanding **syntax**, **indentation**, and **how to run Python files**. These basics will be used in every other folder.

## Practice exercises

1. **Hello program**  
   Write a program that prints your name and your favorite hobby.

2. **Simple calculator**  
   Ask the user for two numbers using `input()`, convert them to `int`, and print their sum.

3. **About me**  
   Create variables for your name, age, and city, then print a sentence using them (e.g. `"My name is ..."`).
