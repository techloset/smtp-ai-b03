# We use variables to store changing data like user info, settings, and results while a program runs.
# Examples of creating and using variables.

# Store simple values in variables
name = "Ali"
age = 20

print("Name:", name)
print("Age:", age)

# Variables can be updated
age = age + 1  # increase age by 1
print("Next year age:", age)

# You can combine text with variables using f-strings
message = f"My name is {name} and I am {age} years old."
print(message)
