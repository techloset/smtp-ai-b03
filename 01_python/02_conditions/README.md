# 02 – Conditions (if / elif / else)

This folder teaches you how to **make decisions** in your code.

## Key ideas

- **if statement**  
  Run a block of code only when a condition is `True`.

- **elif and else**  
  Add more checks (`elif`) and a final “otherwise” case (`else`).

- **Comparison operators**  
  `==`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=` to compare values.

- **Logical operators**  
  `and`, `or`, `not` to combine multiple conditions.

- **Indentation**  
  The spaces at the start of a line show which lines belong to an `if` block.

## Why this matters

Conditions let your programs **react** to different inputs and situations, instead of always doing the same thing.

## Practice exercises

1. **Pass / fail**  
   Ask the user for a test score. If it is 50 or more, print `"Pass"`, otherwise print `"Fail"`.

2. **Even or odd**  
   Ask the user for a number and print whether it is even or odd using the `%` operator.

3. **Ticket price**  
   Ask for age and print a ticket price: children (< 12) get a discount, adults pay full price, seniors (> 60) get a different price.
