"""if / else: choose between two paths

We use if/else when we want to do ONE thing if a condition is True,
and a DIFFERENT thing if it is False.
Example:
- "If score >= 50: Pass, else: Fail"
"""

score = 72

# print("Score:", score)

# if score >= 50:
#     print("Result: Pass")
# else:
#     print("you are fail")


# print("--------------------------------")

# # Real-world style example: even or odd number checker
number = 9

if number % 2 == 1:
    print("this is odd number")
else:
    print("this is even number")
