# A function is a REUSABLE block of code that does a specific task
# Think of it like a recipe - you write it once, use it many times!

# WHY use functions?
# 1. Avoid repeating code
# 2. Make code easier to read
# 3. Break big problems into small pieces



def say_hello():
    print("Hello, World!")

say_hello()  # This runs the function



def greet_user():
    """Prints a friendly greeting"""
    print("Welcome to Python!")
    print("Let's learn functions together!")

greet_user()
