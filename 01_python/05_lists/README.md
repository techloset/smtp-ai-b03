# 05 – Lists

This folder teaches you how to work with **lists**, Python’s main way of storing an ordered collection of items.

## Key ideas

- **Creating lists**  
  Use square brackets: `numbers = [1, 2, 3]`.

- **Indexing and slicing**  
  Access one item with an index (`my_list[0]`) or a range with slices (`my_list[1:3]`).

- **Common list methods**  
  `append`, `insert`, `remove`, `pop`, `sort`, `reverse`, `len`, etc.

- **Iterating over lists**  
  Use `for` loops to process each item in a list.

- **Nested lists**  
  Lists can contain other lists to represent tables or matrices.

## Why this matters

Lists are used everywhere to store and process multiple values, like student names, prices, or results from a calculation.

## Practice exercises

1. **Favorite fruits**  
   Create a list of your 5 favorite fruits and print each one using a `for` loop.

2. **List statistics**  
   Make a list of numbers and print the smallest number, largest number, and the average.

3. **Shopping list**  
   Start with an empty list and let the user enter item names until they type `"done"`, then print the final list.
